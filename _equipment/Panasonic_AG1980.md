## Description

The Panasonic AG-1980 is a popular VHS deck used often for transferring Long Play and Extended Play VHS and S-VHS tapes. These decks have generally good quality, however there are a few known issues to keep in mind.

## Known Issues

### Heavy Dropouts

Heavy dropouts can be introduced by loose connections in the flat flex cables

#### Type

Physical or Parts Issue

#### How It Manifests

The deck will begin to introduce many dropouts into an otherwise stable video signal. It's always good to have a test test handy to be sure that the dropouts aren't inherent to the recorded signal

#### Can It Be Fixed

The deck needs to be opened and the main top board needs to be removed. from there you can wiggle or repeat the flat flex cables. This usually works.

### Does Not Sync to Genlock

This deck does not sync to genlock sent to the video input

#### Type

Playback of Signal Error

#### How It Manifests

As of now don't think there's anyway to sync these decks to genlock, however some people looking into the schematics to see if it's possible.

#### Can It Be Fixed

The deck needs to be opened and the main top board needs to be removed. from there you can wiggle or repeat the flat flex cables. This usually works.

### Divots in main cam rails

This deck has a main cam that is used to move the loading pins. The rails of this cam can become worn over time, causing loading and mechanical issues

#### Type

Physical or Parts Issue

#### How It Manifests

There are many symptoms that can be caused by this. One clear symptom is loading issues. If the deck isn't loading tapes properly or spits them out quickly after loading this may be the issue

#### Can It Be Fixed

The mechanics of the deck need to be operated on if it has this problem. If there are divots in the rails the rails will need to be gently filed to make the edges of the divots less extreme, as long as the divots are not in a pin's resting position. Filing the divots if they are in the pin's resting position could throw the deck out of alignment, so be careful. The easiest way to prevent this from happening in the first place is to ensure that the cam is properly greased.
