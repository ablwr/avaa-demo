This artifact refers to any errors that occur when a tape recorded as one system is played back on a deck using another system.

## Definition
The three most common video encoding systems are NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. These standards determine how the video information is encoded and decoded. The use of these color systems is localized to countries and regions. The map below shows where these video systems are used around the globe. It is impossible to tell which color system a tape is recorded in without playing it back. If a tape from one system is played back on a deck that uses another system the image will be scrambled, discolored, or completely illegible.

To further complicate the matter, there are old formats that use unstandardized color encoding systems, distinct from the video encoding system, such as the Sony A5000. Before the EIAJ standard was put in place, Sony developed their own A5000 system and released decks that used it. However, once the EIAJ color system was standardized the A5000 decks became obsolete, and the decks that play these back are very rare. A5000 tapes look physically identical to EIAJ tapes, but cannot be played properly on EIAJ decks

## Can it be fixed?
Tapes can only be played on a deck that uses the same system or standard used to record tape. It is not possibly to fix issues caused by a system mismatch in any way other than using the correct equipment.
